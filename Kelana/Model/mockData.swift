Locals call this waterfall a twin waterfall, since there are a couple streams of water falling down the cliff from 20 meters high. This beauty waterfall  is an entirely natural trail that’s rarely traveled, unlike others.  Its water curtain of diverse trickles of water cascades over a wall of luxuriant rocks just past the waterfall.  Probably, will be a bit difficult to find Banyumala Waterfalls. But, it’s a worthy journey for the view alone."),
